CONFIGURING EXISTING SOFTWARE

Not only LDV requires the software described to be installed.  You also should
ensure that it's tweaked correctly.

Control groups

LDV accounts and limits CPU and memory on the basis of control groups.

For correct memory computation (memory + swap) next kernel flags should be set:                                      
  CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP and CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP_ENABLED                                  
or if kernel >3.6 version                                                                                            
  CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP and CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED                                                              
Minimal kernel version for swap computation is 2.6.34.                                                               
Alternatively kernel boot parameter swapaccount should be set to 1.                                                  
For Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.04 one needs to:                                                                             
  1. Add "swapaccount=1" to value of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT located in /etc/default/grub.                  
  2. Run sudo update-grub.                                                                                     
  3. Reboot your system.                                                                                       
For openSUSE 13.1 and Fedora 19 one needs to:                                                                        
  1. Add "swapaccount=1" to value of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT located in /etc/default/grub.                  
  2. Run sudo /usr/sbin/grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg.
  3. Reboot your system.
You can use LDV without swap account at your own risk. Set LDV_WORK_WITHOUT_SWAP_ACCOUNT
environment variable for that.

MySQL

Extend "maximal packet size". LDV uploads source files to database, and they
may get huge. 10Mb is enough. Update current value of max_allowed_packet or add
the following lines to /etc/my.cnf:
	[mysqld]
	max_allowed_packet = 10M

To upload knowledge base triggers to databases you need to set up following 
variable from super user mysql console:
	SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1;
This definition works until mysql server is stopped.
Following lines inside /etc/my.cnf (openSUSE) in section [mysqld] works everytime:
	# This allows nonsuper users to create triggers and functions
	log_bin_trust_function_creators = 1

LDV tools causes mysql to create big binary logs during their work. To avoid this
one can limit these logs by adding to section [mysqld] following lines:
	# To clean up old binary logs automatically
	expire_logs_days=7
or disable mysql binary logs at all by commenting a log-bin variable setting.
In order to make changes to take effect you need to restart mysql server or/and
run 'flush logs' command in mysql console (under root). 
For more details you can see http://forge.ispras.ru/issues/2316.

If you want to share your database (e.g. if you want to use remote LDV Analytics
Center) you must enable remote connection to your local mysql server. Read
manuals avalable for your particular distribution. Most likely you must comment
setting skip-networking or/and bind-address variables in my.cnf. Also you must
enable access to the database, e.g. from mysql console (you can see this manual
for more details: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/adding-users.html):
mysql> grant all on DATABASE_NAME.* to USER_NAME;
mysql> flush privileges;

INSTALLING LDV

Run: 
  make console-tools
and then:
  sudo prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-console-tools

If you need to install visualization stuff (most likely you need this if you
are outside ISP RAS), then follow stats-visualizer/README. Then run:
  make visualization
and then:
  sudo prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-visualization
Once after installation or after each change of LDV Analytics Center
configuration you need to manually restart apache2 service, e.g. by means of
"/etc/init.d/apache2 restart" on openSUSE 11.2 (on system rebooting this will
be done automatically if you have added that service to the autostarting ones).

Testing stuff, e.g. for rule models testing, can be installed by:
  make testing
and:
  sudo prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-testing


TODO: sort the text below out

Note, that '3' and '5' most likely require root privelegies and additional
tuning. See 'stats-visualizer/README' for details. See 'ldv-online/README'
before installing '6' and '7'.

  1. To install the LDV console tools use:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install

  2. To install verifiers only:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-verifiers

  3. To install the statistics server use (please, refer to
     stats-visualizer/README for details and problems!)
     sudo prefix=/path/to/some/directory make install-visualization
     (Since it will most likely require root access, install it separately)

  4. To install tests use:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-testing

  5. To install everything use (also including ldv-online):
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-all

  6. To install ldv-git:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-ldv-git

  7. To install cluster (both node and server):
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-ldv-cluster

  8. To install error trace visualizer:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-etv

For some tools that use LDV to work, you need to add directory with binaries to
your path:

	export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/prefix/bin

Here `/path/to/prefix` is what you've specified as prefix wile installing the
above tools.

You may skip installing BLAST reachability C verifier (this is useful if you
have your own, and are not going to use the default one).  To do this, add the
following variable when installing:

	no_blast=y prefix=/path make install
