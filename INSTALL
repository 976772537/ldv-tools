CONFIGURING EXISTSING SOFTWARE

Not only LDV requires the software described to be installed.  You also should
ensure that it's tweaked correctly.


MySQL

Extend "maximal packet size".  LDV uploads source files to database, and they
may get huge.  10Mb is enough; just add the following lines to /etc/my.cnf:
	[mysqld]
	max_allowed_packet = 10M

INSTALLING LDV

First, install a prerequisites listed above, according to the path of LDV you
need.

Note, that '3' and '5' most likely require root privelegies and additional
tuning. See 'stats-visualizer/README' for details. See 'ldv-online/README'
before installing '6' and '7'.

  1. To install the LDV console tools use:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install

  2. To install verifiers only:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-verifiers

  3. To install the statistics server use:
     sudo prefix=/path/to/some/directory make install-visualization
     (Since it will most likely require root access, install it separately)

  4. To install tests use:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-testing

  5. To install everything use (also including ldv-online):
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-all

  7. To install ldv-git:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-ldv-git

For some tools that use LDV to work, you need to add directory with binaries to
your path:

	export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/prefix/bin

Here `/path/to/prefix` is what you've specified as prefix wile installing the
above tools.

You may skip installing BLAST reachability C verifier (this is useful if you
have your own, and are not going to use the default one).  To do this, add the
following variable when installing:

	no_blast=y prefix=/path make install
