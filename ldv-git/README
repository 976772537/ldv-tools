LDV-GIT
=======

LDV-GIT is an infrastructure to support continious monitoring of quality of
Linux Kernel drivers.

During that monitoring, the Kernel is analyzed with static analysis tools
provided by Linux Driver Verification project (LDV).  You can find more
about LDV at http://linuxtesting.org/ldv.

The main feature of LDV-GIT is that it supports incremental checking.  If a
certain version of a kernel has already been checked, and you check another
version, which is based on it, LDV-GIT makes LDV check only drivers,
behavior of which could change.  Not only it takes direct file modifications
into account, but also calling functions from a file that could change, and
includeing a modified header file.
