TUTORIAL
========
   
   I. PREPARE
      You should prepare database and environment variables before verification start. 
      This procedure is performed only once for each instance of ldv-tools. It is 
      minimal requieres for work with ldv-tools.

      1. Create database:
  	  - Install and configure mysql server and client if it is not installed
          - Start mysql server daemon: 
            sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld
	  - Connect to db server as root like this: 
            mysql -u root -p rootpassword
	  - Create db for ldv-tools: 
            CREATE DATABASE dbname;
  	  - Create user for stats db:
            CREATE USER 'dbuser'@'dbhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dbpass';
	  - Add priviledges: 
            GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbname.* TO 'dbuser'@'dbhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	  - Update privileges: 
            FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	  - Create tables 
            MySQL -uuser -ppass -hhost dbname < \
            PATH_TI_INSTALLED_LDV/ldv-manager/results_schema.sql

      2. Set environment variable (If yuo do not want to set it each times then
         write it to ~/.bashrc):
         export PATH:$PATH:PATH_TO_INSTALLED_LDV/bin 

      You can create more than one databases (step one) if you do not want to 
      mix results from different launches. 


  II. VERIFY DRIVER
      Now you can verify your drivers by means of ldv-manager. Simple
      way to use it:

      1. Starting verify process
          - Create direcory for work with ldv-tools. 
            mkdir ~/sample
          - Change dir to folder you created.
            cd ~/sample
          - Take the kernel from which your driver should work. You can download it
            from http://www.kernel.org.
            wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.36.tar.bz2	
          - Ensure that your drivers satisfy the following requirements:
             * The driver is archived using gzip or bzip2 and has one of the 
               following extensions: .tar.bz2, tar.gz, .tgz
             * Archive should contain: Makefile (written to be compiled with the 
               selected kernel)
             * Sources needed by Makefile
             * Archive should not contain generated files left from builds
          - Look at the model database (LDV_INSTALLED_DIR/kernel-rules/model-db.xml) 
            and select id from interesting model. More details about rules we can 
            see in LDV_INSTALLED_DIR/kernel-rules/rules/DRVRULES_en.trl. 
            Also you may see rule description on web site
            http://www.linuxtesting.org/ldv/online?action=rules
          - Start verification:
            ldv-manager "envs=linux-2.6.31.6.tar.bz2" "drivers=PATH_TO_YOUR_DRIVER" \
            "rule_models=32_7,32_1"
      
      It is possible to verify some drivers with differrent rules for single run. Also
      you can verify modules from Linux kernel. Information about all opportunities and
      options for ldv-manager is in the file ./ldv-manager/README. To verify drivers from
      Linux kernel git repository see ./ldv-git/README.


 III. VIEW RESULTS 
      You can find pax file in ./finished dir after verification is finished.
      PAX file contains verification results. Use a web interface of stats server 
      to view it. Detailed information about installing and using stats server  
      you'll find in ./stats-visualizer/README.

      1. Upload results to databases:
         LDVDB=dbname LDVUSER=dbuser LDVDBPASSWD=dbpass LDVDBHOST=localhost ldv-upload
      2. View link (with corresponding database name, user name, password etc) in browser
         http://localhost:8999/stats/index/name/dnname/host/localhost/user/dbuser/password/dbpass

      Note: Stats server not installed by default. 

  Verification as web-service. 
  ldv-tools have another way to verify your drivers. To use this way follow next steps:
      - install ldv-online (for more info ./ldv-online/README) 
      - open link http://localhost/ldv_online_service.php
