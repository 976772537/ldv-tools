# GENERIC CC/LD COMMANDS
#======================================================================
# CC/LD in RCV backends represent information flow instead of actual commands.

These and only these C files should be analyzed when an LD command is encountered.
#
# In this section we introduce the subroutines that provide this functionality.  The tool-specific functionality is supplied as a hook (Subroutine) given as an argument.  Some other options are available as well.
