To install the statics server you may copy the file 'config.sample' that is
placed at the current directory to the file 'config' also placed at the
current directory and define your own values of variables there.
Also you may specify them through the corresponding environment variables.
Note that environment variables are preferable.

Then, run "make install-visualization" from the root ldv-tools directory.

Note! Most likely you must install the statistics server under root since it
have to copy files to web server virtual host and configuration directories.

Well known problems.
1. It seems that usually the required web server module mod_rewrite is turned
   off. So you must read documentation on your web server to turn it on.
2. If you'll see absolutely blank page after some action or even at the
   beginning it is most likely that the statistics server exceeds the default
   memory limit (256Mb). I hope that there won't be such problems if an used
   database is filled with data correctly. To fix the problem you can enlarge
   the default memory limit in the file vhosts/ldv-stats/public/.htaccess
   placed respectively to the given directory. Also please send a message to
   the development team.

After installation you must restart your web server to see the statistics server
on the specified port.

Visit http://localhost:8999 (with default port) by means of your browser.
