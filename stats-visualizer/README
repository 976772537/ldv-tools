To install the statics server you may copy the file 'config.sample' that is
placed at the current directory to the file 'config' also placed at the 
current directory and define your own values of variables there. 
Also you may specify them through the corresponding environment variables. 
Note that environment variables are preferable.

Note! Most likely you must install the statistics server under root since it
have to copy files to web server virtual host and configuration directories.

Well known problems. It seems that usually the required web server module 
mod_rewrite is turned off. So you must read documentation on your web server
to turn it on.

After installation you must restart your web server to see the statistics server
on the specified port.

Visit http://localhost:8999 (with default port) by means of your browser.
