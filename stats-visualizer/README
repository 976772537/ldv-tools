To install the statics server you may copy the file 'config.sample' that is
placed in the current directory to the file 'config' and define your own values
of variables there. Also you may specify them through the corresponding
environment variables. Note that environment variables are preferable.

Note! Most likely you must install the statistics server under root since it
copy files to web server virtual host and configuration directories.

After installation you must restart your web server to see the statistics server
on the specified port (8999 by default).
