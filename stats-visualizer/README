To install the statics server you may copy the file 'config.sample' that is
placed at the current directory to the file 'config' also placed at the
current directory and define your own values of variables there.
Also you may specify them through the corresponding environment variables.
Note that environment variables are preferable.

Then, run "make install-visualization" from the root ldv-tools directory.

Note! Most likely you must install the statistics server under root since it
have to copy files to web server virtual host and configuration directories.

Well known problems.
1. It seems that usually the required web server module mod_rewrite is turned
   off. So you must read documentation on your web server to turn it on.
2. Some systems don't allow to web server to read something from directories
   except default web server directories. When you see in web server error log
   (see "Other problems" describing how to read this log) something like:
   [Mon Jul 30 15:19:56 2012] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] PHP Fatal error:  require_once(): Failed opening required 'Zend/Application.php' (include_path='/srv/www/vhosts/ldv-stats/library:.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /srv/www/vhosts/ldv-stats/public/index.php on line 34
   we adice you to install statistics server directly into web server virtual
   hosts directory, i.e. specify set up prefix that equals to the value of
   LDV_STATS_VHOSTS_DIR variable from config you used. In the case above it 
   should be prefix=/srv/www/vhosts.
3. If you'll see absolutely blank page after some action or even at the
   beginning it is most likely that the statistics server exceeds the default
   memory limit (256Mb). I hope that there won't be such problems if an used
   database is filled with data correctly. To fix the problem you can enlarge
   the default memory limit in the file vhosts/ldv-stats/public/.htaccess
   placed respectively to the given directory and reinstall statistics server.
   Also please send a message to the development team.
   
Other problems.
Inspect web server logs to understand what happens. On openSUSE this can be done
in the following manner:
$ tail /var/log/apache2/error_log
$ tail /var/log/apache2/access_log
Other systems may place these logs into another directory. If you encontered
some specific problem, please, don't forget to report developers about it (e.g.
here http://forge.ispras.ru/projects/ldv/).

After installation you must restart your web server to see the statistics server
on the default or specified port. On openSUSE it can be done via executing under
root:
$ /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Visit http://localhost:8999 (if you don't specify another port) by means of your
browser.
