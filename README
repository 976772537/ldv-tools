LDV
===

  Linux Driver Verification (LDV) program was announced in 2009 to meet
  increased demand for large-scale verification tools applicable to high
  profile software. The goals of the program are:

       o improve quality of Linux device drivers
       o develop an integrated platform for device drivers verification
       o adopt latest research outcome to enhance quality of verification tools

  The quality improvement involves garnering and systematizing problems that
  occur in device drivers and actually finding their instances (bugs) in the
  source code. Based on analysis of error reports to LKML, a number of
  frequently encountered problems was encapsulated into a rule database. The
  rules are formalized, categotized, and supplied with machine-readable
  patterns that show how to verify them.

  The integrated platform aims to mediate smoothly between driver's source
  packages, brand new, fresh kernels from kernel.org, rule database and
  general-purpose verification tools, given that all these are constantly
  developed. This platform provides analysis of the drivers supplied in
  automatically deployed and generated environments, which are based on
  vanilla kernel sources and rule database mentioned earlier.

  The verification process is backed with open-source verification tools for C
  language. The modular architecture of the integrated platform, and a large
  amount of ready-to-check source code provides extensive basis for audit of
  quality of different verification tools. The tools are constantly improved
  (based on research, both adopted and carried on by our group) and evaluated
  to provide the most precise verification.

GETTING LATEST SOURCES OF LDV
=============================

  LDV sources are stored in several Git repositories. To download them, you
  currently need a Git version control system installed at your machine. Git
  is free software, and you can download it here http://git-scm.com/download.

  You can get latest stable and unstable sources of LDV tools at development
  homepage at http://forge.ispras.ru/projects/ldv.

  We recommend using Git of version 1.6.6 or newer. With this version getting
  sources is easy:

    $ git clone --recursive git://forge.ispras.ru/ldv-tools.git
     (you'll download about 200 Mb)

  If your git version is lower than 1.6.6, and you can't upgrade, refer to
  section "USING OBSOLETE GIT".


HOW TO INSTALL
==============

  Please, refer to INSTALL file for the list of prerequisites and installation
  instructions.

HOW TO USE
==========

      RUNNING

  The verification process is launched by means of the ldv manager tool. If
  you want to understand deeper how to use this tool please read its manual
  placed here:
    # SOURCE_DIR is a directory where the ldv tools were downloaded.
    SOURCE_DIR/ldv-tools/ldv-manager/README

  Please pay your attention. Kernel archives and extrenal drivers archives
  should be placed directly in your working directory.


      EXAMPLES

  To set up environment you may do following stages:
    # INSTALL_DIR is a directory where the ldv tools were installed.
    export PATH=$PATH:INSTALL_DIR/bin
    # TEST_DIR is your working directory where the ldv tools will place their
    # temporary files and store results of their work
    cd TEST_DIR
    wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.34.tar.bz2

  To verify all or some portion of kernel drivers you may use:
    ldv-manager "envs=linux-2.6.34.tar.bz2" kernel_driver=1 \
    "drivers=drivers/usb/storage/" "rule_models=39_1"

  To verify one external driver (don't forget to place it into the TEST_DIR):
    ldv-manager tag=current "envs=linux-2.6.32.9.tar.bz2" \
    "drivers=hdpvr-core.tar.bz2" "rule_models=39_1"


      VIEW RESULTS

  To view verification results and some auxiliary information, you should
  install the stats visualizer tool.  The tool is implemented as a web server,
  and can be run by Apache and mod_php. To learn how to set it up, please, see:
    SOURCE_DIR/stats-visualizer/INSTALL

  Note that also you should set up a MySQL database:
    - Install MySQL if it is not installed.
    - Create your database and user with write privileges.
    - Upload the database schema to the created database. The schema is there:
        INSTALL_DIR/ldv-manager/results_schema.sql

  LDV tools results are uploaded to the database as in the following instruction:
    SOURCE_DIR/ldv-tools/ldv-manager/README

  In a nutshell, having set the proper environment variables that specify your
  database connection parameters (user, host, database, etc), you just run:
    ldv-upload finished/package.pax

  where package.pax is the package named after your driver.

  The statistics server will be available trough your browser. To see it you must
  specify database connection options in URL.

      EXAMPLES

  To upload results you can use:
    cd TEST_DIR
    # A directory 'finished' will contains archives corresponding to your
    # ldv-manager invocation.
    LDVDB=ldvdb LDVUSER=ldvreports ldv-upload \
    finished/default--X--drivers-usb-storage---X--default.pax

  To see results in your browser put corresponding URL in the address bar:
    http://localhost:8999/stats/index/name/ldvdb/user/ldvreports/password/no

      TUTORIAL

  More information about starting with ldv tools you can see in ./TUTORIAL file.

USING OBSOLETE GIT
==================

  In this section you may learn how to download tools if your Git version is
  less than 1.6.6.

  If you have a prior to 1.6.6 version of Git, you can't use git clone
  --recursive, because the feature was only introduced in 1.6.6. Since git
  uses recursive submodules (one submodule is inside the other), it would be
  tedious to make you change directories and run many commands manually. So, we
  supply you with some automation that can do it for you. First, add the
  following lines to ~/.gitconfig:

   [alias]
        subinit = !"git submodule init; git submodule update ; git \
        submodule foreach 'git subinit'"

  Note that the name of this alias (at left-hand side of = sign) should match
  the one invoked at the end of this line!
  Then clone without --recursive, and invoke the command you've just added
  to ~/.gitconfig in the new working directory:

    $ git clone git://forge.ispras.ru/ldv-tools.git
    $ cd ldv-tools
    $ git subinit

  Downloading sources of subprojects (submodules) is crucial. LDV-tools won't
  build without submodules.
