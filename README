	Linux Driver Verification (LDV) <http://linuxtesting.org/project/ldv/>

These are the notes for LDV.  Read them carefully,
as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the
LDV, and what to do if something goes wrong. 

WHAT IS LDV?

  Linux Driver Verification (LDV) program was announced in 2009 to meet 
  increased demand for large-scale verification tools applicable to high 
  profile software. The goals of the program are:

       o improve quality of Linux device drivers
       o develop an integrated platform for device drivers verification
       o adopt latest research outcome to enhance quality of verification tools

  The quality improvement involves garnering and systematizing problems that
  occur in device drivers and actually finding their instances (bugs) in the 
  source code. Based on analysis of error reports to LKML, a number of
  frequently encountered problems was encapsulated into a rule database. The
  rules are formalized, categotized, and supplied with machine-readable 
  patterns that show how to verify them.

  The integrated platform aims to mediate smoothly between driver's source 
  packages, brand new, fresh kernels from kernel.org, rule database and 
  general-purpose verification tools, given that all these are constantly
  developed. This platform provides analysis of the drivers supplied in
  automatically deployed and generated environments, which are based on 
  vanilla kernel sources and rule database mentioned earlier.

  The verification process is backed with open-source verification tools for C 
  language. The modular architecture of the integrated platform, and a large 
  amount of ready-to-check source code provides extensive basis for audit of 
  quality of different verification tools. The tools are constantly improved 
  (based on research, both adopted and carried on by our group) and evaluated 
  to provide the most precise verification.

INSTALLING the LDV:

  1. To install the ldv console tools use:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install
  2. To install the only verifiers:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-verifiers
  3. To install the statistics server use:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-visualization
  4. To install tests use:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-testing
  5. To install all use:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory make install-all
  6. To install online web-service:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory TMP_DIR=/path/to/tmpfiles
     	WEB_DIR=/path/to/apahce/web/dir make install-online-server
  7. To install online web-service node:
     prefix=/path/to/your/installation/directory TMP_DIR=/path/to/tmpfiles 
	make install-online-node

Note, that '3' and '5' most likely require root privelegies and additional
setup. See 'stats-visualizer/README' for details. See 'ldv-online/README'
 before installing '6' and '7'.
