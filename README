LDV 
===

  Linux Driver Verification (LDV) program was announced in 2009 to meet 
  increased demand for large-scale verification tools applicable to high 
  profile software. The goals of the program are:

       o improve quality of Linux device drivers
       o develop an integrated platform for device drivers verification
       o adopt latest research outcome to enhance quality of verification tools

  The quality improvement involves garnering and systematizing problems that
  occur in device drivers and actually finding their instances (bugs) in the 
  source code. Based on analysis of error reports to LKML, a number of
  frequently encountered problems was encapsulated into a rule database. The
  rules are formalized, categotized, and supplied with machine-readable 
  patterns that show how to verify them.

  The integrated platform aims to mediate smoothly between driver's source 
  packages, brand new, fresh kernels from kernel.org, rule database and 
  general-purpose verification tools, given that all these are constantly
  developed. This platform provides analysis of the drivers supplied in
  automatically deployed and generated environments, which are based on 
  vanilla kernel sources and rule database mentioned earlier.

  The verification process is backed with open-source verification tools for C 
  language. The modular architecture of the integrated platform, and a large 
  amount of ready-to-check source code provides extensive basis for audit of 
  quality of different verification tools. The tools are constantly improved 
  (based on research, both adopted and carried on by our group) and evaluated 
  to provide the most precise verification.

GETTING LATEST SOURCES OF LDV
=============================

  LDV sources are stored in several Git repositories. To download them, you
  currently need a Git version control system installed at your machine. Git 
  is free software, and you can download it here http://git-scm.com/download.

  You can get latest stable and unstable sources of LDV tools at development
  homepage at http://forge.ispras.ru/projects/ldv
 
  We recommend using Git of version 1.6.6 or newer. With this version getting 
  sources is easy:

    $ git clone --recursive git://forge.ispras.ru/ldv-tools.git
     (you'll download about 200 Mb)

  If you have a prior to 1.6.6 version of Git, you can't use git clone 
  --recursive, because the feature was only introduced in 1.6.6. Since git 
  uses recursive submodules (one submodule is inside the other), it would be 
  tedious to make you change directories and run many commands manually. So, we 
  supply you with some automation that can do it for you. First, add the 
  following lines to ~/.gitconfig:

   [alias]
        subinit = !"git submodule init; git submodule update ; git \ 
        submodule foreach 'git subinit'" 
 
  Note that the name of this alias (at left-hand side of = sign) should match 
  the one invoked at the end of this line!
  Then clone without --recursive, and invoke the command you've just added 
  to ~/.gitconfig in the new working directory:

    $ git clone git://forge.ispras.ru/ldv-tools.git
    $ cd ldv-tools
    $ git subinit

  Downloading sources of subprojects (submodules) is crucial. LDV-tools won't 
  build without submodules.


HOW TO INSTALL
==============

  Please, refer to INSTALL file for the list of prerequisites and installation
  instructions.

HOW TO USE
==========
   
  Running.

  To run verification by means of ldv-manager read 
  SOURCE_DIR/ldv-tools/ldv-manager/README

  To run current version of ldv-tools (from PATH) using tag=current!
  Environment variable PATH must contains path to bin folder of 
  installed ldv-tools. 

  Example:
  export PATH=$PATH:INSTALL_DIR/bin
  cd TEST_DIR # your work dir with temporary files
  wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.34.tar.bz2
  ldv-manager "envs=linux-2.6.34.tar.bz2" kernel_driver=1 \ 
  "drivers=drivers/usb/storage/" "rule_models=39_1"
  
  Attension! For now, kernel archives and extrenal drivers archives should be
  in the TEST_DIR.

  Example for running with one driver:
  ldv-manager "envs=linux-2.6.32.9.tar.bz2" "drivers=hdpvr-core.tar.bz2" \
  "rule_models=39_1"

  View statistics.

  To view the statistics you need to install stats-visualizer (see 
  SOURCE_DIR/stats-visualizer/INSTALL). 
  It will also require a MySQL database:
	- Install and MySQL if it is not installed.
        - Create database and user with right privileges.
	- Create tables INSTALL_DIR/ldv-manager/results_schema.sql

  Verification results are loading to database in conformity with
  instruction SOURCE_DIR/ldv-tools/ldv-manager/README

  Exmaple:
  LDVDB=ldvdb LDVUSER=ldvreports INSTALL_DIR/bin/ldv-upload \
  finished/default--X--drivers-usb-storage---X--default.pax

  Next,  open the stats server  (DB parameters specified in URL)
  and view results. 

  More information about starting with ldv-tools you can see 
  in ./TUTORIAL file.
