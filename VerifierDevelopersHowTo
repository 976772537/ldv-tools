	Linux Driver Verification (LDV)

	HowTo for Developers of static Verifiers


One of the aims of the LDV program is helping developers of Static Analysis
tools ("verifiers") to create better tools.  Driver sources aren't hard to
verify, and their varying size fits well the purpose of scalability testing.
This file lists the options the developers of analysis tools have, and provides
help for those who might want to use CPAchecker with our tools.

Modular architecture of LDV tools makes it possible to replace one static code
checker with another, as long as the tool can solve reachability problem for C
language.  We call such tools "Reachability C Verifiers" (or, RCVs).

Unfortunately, due to low demand on such functionality, the interface is not
well-developed, and is prohibitively hard to develop for the people not involved
in the project.

However, we integrated support of BLAST and CPAchecker as verifiers into our
tools.


HOW TO USE CPACHECKER
=====================

To use CPAchecker as RCV, you should first install your tools as usual, with a
few optional actions to perform.  Refer to INSTALL file, but you may skip those
prerequisites which refer to "BLAST" verifier shipped by default.  If you skip
them, you must use "no_blast=y" option when installing the toolset.

Install the following components: install-visualization, install-testing.

You most likely would want to run all drivers in a kernel, or run the "general"
regression test set (this test set contains "interesting" drivers of various
sizes).  The only difference with default workflow (about which you can read in
README and TUTORIAL) is that you should set some additional environment
variables before you run the tools.  Here's the list of them:

RCV_VERIFIER=cpachecker
	Use CPAchecker as RCV.  If you don't specify it, the tools will default
	to using BLAST (and fail if you don't have it installed).

CPACHECKER=/path/to/cpa.sh
	Specify location of CPAchecker cpa.sh script.  By default, it runs
	"cpa.sh" found in your PATH environment variable.

CPACHECKER_CONFIG=/path/to/config.cfg
	If yon don't want to use the default config (which is found in
	dscv/rcv/cpachecker.config/cpa.cfg.pattern), you may specify your own
	through this variable.  Note that it will be copied, and some options will be
	adjusted in it!
	Sorry, the file name must be absolute.

CPACHECKER_OPTIONS=
	Additional options for CPAchecker.  You should not set "-config" option
	here.

LDV_DEBUG=20
	To see the exact command lines, with which CPAchecker is invoked, you might
	want to increase the verbosity level.  Level of 20 is enough to see calls to
	CPAchecker; you may increase it up to 100 (but you might not really want to).

RCV_TIMELIMIT=900    (seconds)
RCV_MEMLIMIT=0       (megabytes)
	Reachability C Verifiers are run under inspection.  If they violate time- or
	memory limit, they're terminated.  The number of violations of time and memory
	limits is calculated and can be viewed in final statistics.

	Since CPAchecker already contains memory limiting mechanism, memory limit is
	not set by default (however, violations of Java's natively set limit are
	tracked).  Time is limited with 15 minutes.  You can decrease, increase or
	unset the time limit to adjust performance of your tools.

It could be a good idea to add these options to a file and just use "source"
shell command to apply them to the current environment.

Launch several verification tasks on the same toolset, but with different
configs/verifiers, don't forget to assign different descriptions to these
launches, and check difference between checker performances in the web interface
(stats-visualization).  If you see too much numbers, try adding "profile/rcv/"
to the URL!

Good luck in your development!
