UNIT-TESTS for DSCV and RCV backends.

This folder contains them.

To run unit-tests, please, from the parent directory, execute

	prefix=/where/to/install/tests \
	test_dir=/where/to/execute/tests \
	make unit-tests

Special "mock" RCV backend is created to test DSCV (it's placed in rcv/backends directory).  Also, a fake Rule-Instrumentor is made, and it is the unit-tests/fakeri script.


Each test is a command.xml file and source code files. The command.xml file contains commands to execute, and correct answers in form of parameters.

In source code files, for each main to check there must persist a verdict: safe, unsafe or unknown.  Verdict is a capitalized word that must encounter between first occurence of the name of the main and the next line that starts with '}'.  Note that this string should persist through preprocessing, CILlifying and LLVM-ing (for example, it could be a function with a defined body).
