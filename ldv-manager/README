LDV-MANAGER

Infrastructure to run and collect statistics of LDV runs.

PREREQUISITES:
=============

1. MySQL server and libmysqlclient15-dev+ 
2. Ruby v1.8+
3. Ruby gems package and the following gems:
	gem install hpricot
	gem install activerecord
	gem install mysql
4. GNU Make
5. Perl
6. MySQL with InnoDB
7. PAX archiver (that's POSIX standard actually) and CPIO archiver


INSTALLATION
============

First you should install ldv-manager.  You can do it by changing into its directory and running

	make install prefix=where/to/install

or by calling

	make install-all

from ldv-tools root dir.


HOW TO USE LDV-MANAGER
======================

As usual, change into an empty directory.  That will be your working dir.

LDV-manager is implemented as makefiles (yes, again.  Sorry.)  All variables should be specified through command line, however, some rarely changing ones (such as repository addresses) may be stored in "config.mk" file in current directory.  Do not forget to export variables in config.mk (done in the same way as in shell) if you want them to appear in environment of the commands called!

Input to ldv-manger is its command line.  Output is the files that appear in RESULTS_DIR (that's environment/config variable).  The files given as an input (archives with kernels and drivers) should be in the working directory.

Here's how the call looks like (make sure you've installed LDV manager, and ldv-manager command is in your PATH):

	LDV_GIT_REPO=git://itgdev/ldv-tools.git \
	ldv-manager \
	tag=test-0.1 \
	"envs=linux-2.6.31.2.tar.bz2" \
	"drivers=wl12xx.tar.bz2" \
	"rule_models=8_1 32_1"
	ldv_statuses=0

If you are checking kernel drivers, then specify the folder you want to check in `drivers` variable, AND also set `kernel_driver=1` in addition to the other options.

You may also want to specify "name" variable to be able to distinguish runs by some other parameters.

If you want to re-run the process for an already checked driver, you most likely will see "nothing to do" message.  To make your results out of date, you should touch the file with driver.

	touch driver.tar.gz

For kernel drivers there's no way to achieve this bit to erase certain folders from within work/ subdirectory.  By the way, you may erase only `finished` file from the directory, if you only want to re-package the checking results.  By erasing `checked` file, you re-run the whole check.

If you need to run LDV-manager with currently installed tools (instead of making ldv-manager install them), you should specify tag=current.  In this case LDV_GIT_REPO may be omitted.


HOW TO USE DATABASE
===================

LDV-manager doesn't add anything to database.  The 'ldv-upload' script does that.

First, you should prepare DB schema.  Just execute results_schema.sql file to ERASE all existing tables and create schema for the new.

Set up LDVDBHOST, LDVDB, LDVUSER, LDVDBPASSWD shell variables to gain the proper access to database.  Then just run ldv-upload script on the files that are gotten from the ldv-manager:

	ldv-mangaer/ldv-upload package_from_ldv_manager.

At the point of uploading, Known Problems are automatically calculated based on descriptions.  Problem-scripts (that get description as input and print problems, one per line, as output) reside in ldv-manager/problems/ directory.  If you added more scripts, or modified existing ones, you may call special script.  To recalculate all stats for all scripts in standard directory, run

	ldv-problem-recalc all

To re-run scpecific scripts for specific tools,

	ldv-problem-recalc ri ./ri_script ./ri_another_script


SWITCHING AND TUNING C VERIFIERS
================================

(The following section applies to DSCV and ldv tools as well.)

Reachability C Verifier switching is implemented.  You may select verifier (it should be a name of a script in dscv/rcv/*), and it will be forced in all checking operations that happen during your task.  Work directories created will contain verifier name.  To set up a specific verifier, set an environment variable:

	RCV_VERIFIER=cpachecker

There's also some variability in how RCV verifier BLAST can be used, as well as generic tweaks to these verifiers.  To limit resources used by verifier, call dscv (i.e. call LDV_MANAGER) with the following environment variables:

	RCV_TIMELIMIT=500      #Set time limit to 500 seconds
	RCV_MEMLIMIT=1000000   #Set memory limit to 1000000 KiloBytes

To save typing, you may add these variables to config.mk, but don't forget to export them!

	export RCV_TIMELIMIT=500
	export RCV_MEMLIMIT=1000000

To tune BLAST with options, you may set BLAST_OPTIONS environment variable.

Information about these limits and these options is saved into the description field for rcv tool.


USING LDV-MANAGER WITH LDV BACKEND
==================================

If ldv-manager should have a sane support of statuses, it should be run with ldv_statuses=1 option.  This turns on setting and changing statuses of launches when ldv abnormally terminates.

Without the ldv_statuses option, ldv-manager fails if ldv fails abnormally.
