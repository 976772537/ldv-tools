LDV-MANAGER

Infrastructure to run and collect statistics of LDV runs.

PREREQUISITES:

1. Ruby v1.8+
2. Ruby gems package and the following gems:
	gem install hpricot
	gem install activerecord
	gem install mysql
3. GNU Make
4. Perl (with XML::Twig)
5. MySQL with InnoDB
6. libmysqlclient15-dev+ 
6. PAX archiver (that's POSIX standard actually)


HOW TO USE LDV-MANAGER

As usual, change into an empty directory.  That will be your working dir.

LDV-manager is implemented as makefiles (yes, again.  Sorry.)  All variables should be specified through command line, however, some rarely changing ones (such as repository addresses) may be stored in "config.mk" file in current directory.

Input to ldv-manger is its command line.  Output is the files that appear in RESULTS_DIR (that's environment/config variable).  The files given as an input (archives with kernels and drivers) should be in the working directory.

Here's how the call looks like:

	LDV_GIT_REPO=git://itgdev/ldv-tools.git \
	make -f /path/to/ldv-tools/ldv-manager/ldv-manager.mk \
	tag=test-0.1 \
	"envs=linux-2.6.31.2.tar.bz2" \
	"drivers=wl12xx.tar.bz2" \
	"rule_models=8_1 32_1"

If you want to re-run the process for an already checked driver, you most likely will see "nothing to do" message.  To make your results out of date, you should touch the file with driver.

	touch driver.tar.gz

For kernel drivers there's no way to achieve this bit to erase certain folders from within work/ subdirectory.

If you need to run LDV-manager with currently installed tools (instead of making ldv-manager install them), you should specify tag=current.


HOW TO USE DATABASE

LDV-manager doesn't add anything to database.  The 'upload' script does that.

First, you should prepare DB schema.  Just execute results_schema.sql file to ERASE all existing tables and create schema for the new.

Set up LDVDBHOST, LDVDB, LDVUSER, LDVDBPASSWD shell variables to gain the proper access to database.  Then just run upload script on the files that are gotten from the ldv-manager:

	ldv-mangaer/upload package_from_ldv_manager.
