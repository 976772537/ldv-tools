Prerequisites include Perl of minimum 5.10 and Perl modules:
Tie::Hash::Indexed and XML::Simple (just for CBMC error traces).

To install standalone Error Trace Visualizer you need to install LDV Tools 
and then copy Error Trace Visualizer like:
  $ cp -rL $LDV_TOOLS_INSTALL_DIR/etv/* etv/

To visualize error traces obtained for CIL files that point to source files
that aren't available, one needs to remove line directives by:
  $ etv/rm-line-directives -c file.c -o file.c.noline.c
then run a verifier with corresponding options for file.c.noline.c and then
visualize an obtained error trace (if so) by means of:
  $ etv/etv -c original_error_trace -s sources -o visualized_error_trace.html --format "BLAST error trace v2.7"
where original_error_trace is the verifier error trace, sources is a file
produced by rm-line-directives script, visualized_error_trace.html is a
visualized error trace in HTML (it can be opened in a standard browser) and
format is one of:
  BLAST error trace v2.7
  CPAchecker error trace v1.1
  CPAchecker error trace v1.2
  UFO error trace
  CBMC error trace v4.5
CBMC error traces should be in XML. For other tools standard error traces 
should be printed.
