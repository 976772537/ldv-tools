# Waiter is a class which implements synchronous waits with aid of AMQP
# Its core is an AMQP's "topic exchange".  To signal that a job is done, initialize a waiter instance and invoke +job_done+ method with a routing key and a payload.
# To wait for such signals, invoke +wait_for+ with a routing key, which can contain AMQP wildcards.
#
# AMQP is used in the following way: +wait_for+ creates temporal queues and establishes a binding with a central exchange (ldv-wait-for-results).  Then, +job_done+ merely publishes it to the exchange.
# If at the moment of publication, no queue with a proper binding is connected to the exchange, the job is kept in the local array, and the waiter wakes up each 5 seconds, and tries to send the requests again.
# Note that +job_done+ won't block in this case, but will just add a packet to a local array and ensure that the eventmachine-based timer is started.  In any case, +job_done+ should be called at master's site, not at node's site.
