NOTE! At the moment KB SQL script too differs from generated by mysql
workbench, for instance, because of manually added triggers and functions.
So, be carefull!

When you edit mysql workbench project and then generate corresponding SQL script
don't forget to change in an automatically generated SQL script the second
foreign key to point to 'traces' table, i.e. replace this:
  CONSTRAINT `fk_results_kb_2`
    FOREIGN KEY (`trace_id` )
    REFERENCES `traces` (`id` )
with this:
  CONSTRAINT `fk_results_kb_2`
    FOREIGN KEY (`trace_id` )
    REFERENCES `traces` (`id` )
(this is required since there is no information on 'traces' table in the
knowledge base mysql workbench project).

Also delete information on schema since this script is intended for an arbitrary
database indeed.
